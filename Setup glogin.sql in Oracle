Setup glogin.sql in Oracle
Customize your SQL*Plus environment with glogin.sql.
Let's take you want to execute some sql commands every time you login to SQL*PLUS. It would be so hard to run those commands manually whenever you start SQL*PLUS. With glogin.sql you can specify the commands you want to run every time you invoke SQL*PLUS.


Any query, script, parameter, PL/SQL code etc, you can simply put under glogin.sql file and SQL*PLUS will first execute glogin.sql before allowing you to query database.


I would like to display below message every time a user logs into the database

setup glogin.sql in oracle - testdb database 


Open the glogin.sql file

vi $ORACLE_HOME/sqlplus/admin/glogin.sql
Put below query at the end of the file

select 'Welcome, you are connected to '||name||' database' "Hello" from v$database;
Save and close. That's it, now whenever you login to SQL*PLUS, you will be greeted with a nice welcome message!
