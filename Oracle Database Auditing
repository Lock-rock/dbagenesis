Secure and monitor your database with Oracle auditing.
Oracle database auditing allows you to monitor certain database actions happening inside the database. Auditing also helps in looking at the actions performed against a particular table, schema or certain specific rows.


You can check database auditing is enabled via SHOW PARAMETER command

Show parameter audit;


The AUDIT_TRAIL parameter defines database auditing status. It can take any of the following values

none - Database auditing is disabled

os - Enabled, audit logs are stored at OS level, not inside the database

db  - Enabled, audit records are stored inside database (SYS.AUD$ table)

db,extended - Same as db but populates SQL_BIND & SQL_TEXT too

xml - Enabled, audit records are stored at OS level in XML format

xml,extended - Same as xml but populates SQL_BIND & SQL_TEXT too

Default is DB if you create database via DBCA, else its NONE

The AUDIT_FILE_DEST parameter defines the OS level location of the audit trail files. By default it is set to adump location.


The AUDIT_SYS_OPERATIONS parameter defines auditing is enabled or disabled for any user connecting to database as SYSDBA. This is enabled by default. All the SYS operations audit records goes to OS level into AUDIT_FILE_DEST location.



Move AUD$ Table to Another Tablespace

By default the SYS.AUD$ (stores db audit records) and SYS.FGA_LOG$ (stores fine grain audit records) tables resides under SYSTEM tablespace

col owner for a10;
col segment_name for a10;
col tablespace_name for a15;
select owner, segment_name, segment_type, tablespace_name, 
  bytes/1024/1024 as MB 
from dba_segments 
where segment_name in ('AUD$','FGA_LOG$');


The DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT package allows you to change the default tablespace. Below query moves AUD$ & FGA_LOG$ tables to USERS tablespace

BEGIN
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.SET_AUDIT_TRAIL_LOCATION(
audit_trail_type           => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_DB_STD,
audit_trail_location_value => 'USERS');
END;
/
If you want to only move AUD$ table then replace audit_trail_type with

audit_trail_type           => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_AUD_STD
If you want to only move FGA_LOG$ table then replace audit_trail_type with

audit_trail_type           => DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_FGA_STD
Enjoy!
