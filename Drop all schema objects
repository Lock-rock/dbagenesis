EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER TABLE '||' "'||c1.owner||'"."'||c1.table_name||'" DROP CONSTRAINT ' || c1.constraint_name;
END LOOP;
FOR c1 IN (SELECT owner,object_name,object_type FROM dba_objects where owner=upper('&shema_name')) LOOP
BEGIN
IF c1.object_type = 'TYPE' THEN
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'DROP '||c1.object_type||' "'||c1.owner||'"."'||c1.object_name||'" FORCE';
