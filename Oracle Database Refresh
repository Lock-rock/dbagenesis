Oracle Data Pump Full DB Refresh (Same Version)

If you have few schemas to refresh, then go with schema level refresh. On source

expdp schemas=QBR directory=DUMPDIR dumpfile=QBR.dmp logfile=export.log
On target, drop all objects owned by the user and perform impdp. Repeat same export and import for each schema you would like to refresh.

impdp schemas=QBR directory=DUMPDIR dumpfile=QBR.dmp logfile=import.log
If you have lot of schemas to refresh, then opt for full DB refresh is good. On source

expdp full=Y directory=DUMPDIR dumpfile=full.dmp logfile=export.log
On target, drop all non-oracle schemas

Drop user <username> cascade;
Make sure target tablespaces have enough space as source and perform import

impdp full=Y directory=DUMPDIR dumpfile=full.dmp logfile=import.log

Oracle Data Pump Full DB Refresh (Different Version)

Performing lower version to higher version data pump refresh is similar to same version refresh. However, when you perform export from higher version (12c) and import into lower version (11g), then you must user VERSION clause while exporting from 12c

expdp full=Y directory=DUMPDIR dumpfile=full.dmp logfile=export.log version=11.2
Now the above exported dump file is ready to be imported into an 11g database!
