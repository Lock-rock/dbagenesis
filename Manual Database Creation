Create an Oracle database manually with detailed instructions.
It’s always a good ideas to create Oracle database using DBCA. This method of creating Oracle database is outdated but you must also know how to create database manually. It is one of the most frequent interview questions too.


Before you start, make sure Oracle software is installed on the server

Copy pfile from any other database server and rename it to new database SID

other database pfile
initproddb.ora

change the file name to reflect new SID
initdevdb.ora
Open the initdevdb.ora file, find and replace all old SID (proddb) with new SID (devdb). Save and close the pfile. Now create all new directories on the server as per the pfile

mkdir <location_from_new_pfile>
Set environmental variables to connect new SID

export ORACLE_SID=devdb
Make sure undo tablespace name is same in pfile and also create database statement

STARTUP NOMOUNT;

CREATE DATABASE devdb
   USER SYS IDENTIFIED BY sys
   USER SYSTEM IDENTIFIED BY sys
   LOGFILE GROUP 1 ('/u01/app/oracle/oradata/devdb/redo01.log') SIZE 100M,
           GROUP 2 ('/u01/app/oracle/oradata/devdb/redo02.log') SIZE 100M
   DATAFILE '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/devdb/system01.dbf' SIZE 325M 
   SYSAUX DATAFILE '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/devdb/sysaux01.dbf' SIZE 325M
   DEFAULT TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp TEMPFILE '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/devdb/temp01.dbf' SIZE 20M
   UNDO TABLESPACE UNDOTBS1 DATAFILE '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/devdb/undotbs01.dbf' SIZE 200M;
